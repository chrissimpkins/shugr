[Shugr](http://shu.gr) is a cross-platform, open source, web browser-based HTML editor that supports rapid development of HTML with the Emmett syntax.

The Emmett syntax is a magic wand for HTML (really!). Once you start using it, you won't turn back.  Shugr makes it accessible from any web browser.
